🧠 About Me
Hi! I'm Ahmed Javed — a curious and driven student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence, now in my 4th semester. I have a solid foundation in programming and a passion for building things that make a difference.
Over time, I’ve explored a wide range of projects — from fun Python-based games and smart ML systems to sleek Flutter mobile apps and organized SQL databases. I enjoy the entire process of turning ideas into working solutions, especially when it involves creativity and logic.
Right now, I’m diving into web development to grow as a full-stack developer. Whether it’s coding a game, designing a mobile app, or training a machine learning model, I’m always excited to learn something new, take on a challenge, and collaborate with like-minded people.

🧩 Projects
Here are some of the things I've built so far — a mix of learning, creativity, and curiosity:

🕹️ Python Mini Games
A collection of small, fun games like:
Head or Tails
Number Guessing
Secret Code Generator
Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) CLI-style game
These helped sharpen my logic and Python fundamentals early on.

🏏 C++ OOP – Cricket Match Simulator
A console-based simulation of a cricket match between two teams.
Built using object-oriented programming in C++, focusing on classes, inheritance, and real-time scoring logic.

🏥 Hospital Management System – MySQL
A relational database system to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and billing.
Designed using SQL queries with proper normalization and entity relationships.

🛒 Grocery Shopping App – Flutter
A sleek, mobile-friendly grocery app built using Flutter.
Includes modern UI, category views, and basic navigation — my first step into cross-platform mobile development.

🧠 Machine Learning & AI Projects (Python)
House Price Prediction – Trained regression models to estimate housing prices based on real-world data.
AI Phishing Detection System – Identifies phishing links and suspicious emails using ML techniques.
Smart Café Enhancement System – Combines machine learning with blockchain concepts to optimize and secure customer experiences in cafés.
